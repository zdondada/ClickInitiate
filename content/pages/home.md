# Listen.. All we get is wins, so we're in this to win with the winners! Tips & tricks are worth, but a pittance, often the conscription of tricksters ....and over here bullshitters get evicted.

# Our vision: Enriching you and your team with killer instincts, digital precision and wisdom that nobody else is in a position to give to you. 

# With about 40 to 50,000 hours invested in this agenda since I decided it was worth the effort, I've ended up in the inevitable position where you can bring in any expert and chances are I will have a leg-up going head-to-head against them. This was an active pursuit, full of tons of effort, that I engaged with for essentially two decades. 

# Now I've got so much passion for being able to empty my head of all the ideas that are pent up by helping others get a leg-up.

# Consider giving ClickInitiate, the project of Zach Bennett, a whirl.
